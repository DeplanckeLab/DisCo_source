# General remarks
The code in the presented form was developed specifically for the purpose of deterministically co-encapsulating two particles in droplets on a microfluidic system (as described in Bues, Biocanin, Pezoldt et al 2020, BioRxiv (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.19.103812). Specifically, it coordinates the real-time analysis of images streamed from a camera connected to a microscope with the actuation of solenoid valves and pressure regulators, connected to a microfluidic device. 

It is written as non-object-oriented in C++, relying on multiple external libraries.
